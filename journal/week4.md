Reflection
I really liked using the coloring for the terminal print statements. I'm going to use that in the future for readability. Postgres wasn't that different from what I remember using sqlite, so the concepts weren't that difficult for me.

Challenges
Connecting to the RDS was somewhat challenging, but I figured it out quickly enough. I wasn't able to connect at first because I didn't create the inbound security group rule for postgres.
